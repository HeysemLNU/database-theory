\section{Idea}
For our project we came up with a multi functional music searching program. Our program solves a lot of difficulties faced by music lovers who would like to keep track of songs they like and search for them based on the lyrics, artist name and even the album name. Thanks to this program they could add, remove and search their favorite songs, artists and albums. For our program our target audience are users who are searching for a song they have heard but do not remember the name or the artist that sang the song. If they remember even a word from the lyrics, they can initiate a search using that word and find the song they are looking for, details about the singer that sang it, details about the album the song belongs in and the rest of the lyrics.
